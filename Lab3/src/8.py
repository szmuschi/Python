# Write a function that receives a single dict parameter named mapping. This dictionary always contains a string key "start". Starting with the value of this key you must obtain a list of objects by iterating over mapping in the following way: the value of the current key is the key for the next value, until you find a loop (a key that was visited before). The function must return the list of objects obtained as previously described.
#
# Ex: loop({'start': 'a', 'b': 'a', 'a': '6', '6': 'z', 'x': '2', 'z': '2', '2': '2', 'y': 'start'}) will return ['a', '6', 'z', '2']


def ex_8(dictionary):
    result = []
    l = []
    key = "start"
    while key not in l:
        l.append(key)
        result.append(dictionary[key])
        key = dictionary[key]
    result.pop()
    return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(ex_8({'start': 'a', 'b': 'a', 'a': '6', '6': 'z', 'x': '2', 'z': '2', '2': '2', 'y': 'start'}))
