# Write a function that receives a number x, default value equal to 1, a list of strings, and a boolean flag set to True. For each string, generate a list containing the characters that have the ASCII divisible by x if the flag is set to True, otherwise it should contain characters that have the non-xvid ASCII code.

 # Example: x = 2, ["test", "hello", "lab002"], flag = False will return (["e", "s"], ["e" . Note: The function must return list of lists.
